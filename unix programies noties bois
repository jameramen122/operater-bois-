ssh linops --> vim .ssh/config --> the file we made to make loggin in easier --> chmod 600 .
ps1='$' --> makes the cmd prompt show as a $ and not name@domain:~$ 



--- ifconfig ---
this command has be depricated
is 'ip addr' now
or use 'ip a' 
--- route has also been depricated
use ip r
--- arp also removed for some reason
use 'ip neigh' or 'ip n'

--- the help commands ---
man --> gets the manual of the command listed after
help --> gets a help page for the command listed after
apropos --> searches the man pages for a keyword
whereis --> locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
whereis -b --> locate the binary file for a command
ssh-keygen --> makes an ssh key dummy

--- netstat ---
ss -ntlp has replaced it. netstat is depricated
remove the '-n' to see the ports as their service, not their number.
sudo ss -ntlp shows the processes that are using the port along with the connection info.

 linux is just the kernal
 
 it started with PDP-7... or MULTIX, a giand heavy peice of shit. multiplex interactive something
 they made Unix... which was better an 1000 different ways. in 1971
 other people made modifications to this OS and in 1983 some dude made GANU
 then in 1991 a man named Linus made what is today Linux... he wanted to call it FreeAxe
 
 then in 1992 Debian made a FUCK TON of different things, one of which is names UBUNTU
 Kali is made off of Debian
 Ubuntu and redhat had many offshutes.
 
 
 ====================================== some more things =================================
 
 you can use 'vim .' to open your diretory listing in vim
 /usr/bin --> holds your binarys
 /usr/sbin --> holds your system binarys, requires the sudo to run (/usr/sbin)
 /usr/local/bin --> holds more if the binarys
 /home --> the default directory. where a lot of the normal things are.
 /usr --> universal system resorces. the catch all for everything that wasn't put in a directory.
 /etc --> the 'everything thats configurable' directory, its like the windows regestry but different.
 /var --> things that are likely to change, so logs an' shit.
 /boot --> boot congif files and the boot process files. grub lives here! :3
 /dev --> the special hardware drivers and shit are here, but ther're not drivers. dev/null our trashcan lives here. the standard in out and err are also here, 
 /lib --> .dll libraries. nothing too crazy.
 /mnt --> shows perm attached external drives
 /media --> removable media. so cd's and shit.
 /opt --> optional things. a reservation of sorts. when you unpack something or download something this is often used
 /run --> run time and variable data, holds data based off of the current running computer session
 /tmp --> tenperarry files, everyone can access this
 /proc --> process information.
 
 =================================== U S E R S   A N D   G R O U P S ==================================================
 
 /etc/passwd --> holds the user info on every user.
 <USER NAME>:<PASSWD>:<UID>:<GID>:<comments>:<home path>:<shell path>
 
 --- ls . ---
 
   U  G  O
 -rw-r--r--
 or 
 drwx-rx-rx
 
 
 --- SUID ---
 
 The SUID is NOT the sticky bit
 
 the SUID is the
 
 ls -lisa /usr/bin/passwd
12062 60 -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 59640 Mar 22  2019 /usr/bin/passwd

the U x bit is an S right now. that is a setting that allows anyuser change the file, but only the entries that are theirs, not anyone elses.

ls -lisa /var/tmp/. 
 29638 4 drwxrwxrwt  6 root root 4096 Aug 17 00:06 .
 
 the letter t states that the owner is the only one that can delete it. -->
 
 ---s--s--t
 and 
 ---S--S--T
 
 the case of the letter deturmines if the x bit is turned on underneath. >:3
